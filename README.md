I work on systems that are meant to be reliable, quiet, and
well-structured — focusing on backend development and the
logic that keeps software running smoothly.

Alongside the backend, I care deeply about how things are
presented to users. I design and build minimal, user-friendly
interfaces where clarity, simplicity, and usability matter
as much as the underlying code.

My interest lies in how systems behave under real conditions,
how data flows through them, and how thoughtful design — both
technical and visual — leads to software that lasts.

This space is intentionally clean.
It’s used for experiments, practice, and building ideas
through code and careful design decisions.

🔍 focus
• backend development & system behavior  
• databases and data flow  
• minimal, user-centered interface design  
• building things that work — and feel right  

🧩 approach
simplicity over noise.  
structure with purpose.  
design and code in balance.

practice. build. refine.
